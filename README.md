# Abstract

This study investigates the impact of class size on first-grade students' mathematical achievement within the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) project. Utilizing a linear mixed-effects model, we examined the effects of class size (small, regular, and regular with aide), school, and race on first-grade math scores. Our analysis revealed that students in small classes outperformed their peers in regular-sized classes, both with and without aides. Furthermore, the study found significant variations in math scores across different schools and identified a notable disparity in performance between black and non-black students. A sensitivity analysis, including a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, was conducted to address potential biases due to student reassignments, confirming the robustness of our findings. This research underscores the significant influence of class size on educational outcomes, providing valuable insights for policymakers and educators aiming to optimize learning environments for elementary school students.


# Introduction 

The importance of class sizes on student achievement is a significant concern for policymakers in the American K-12 education system. To investigate this, the Tennessee State Department of Education initiated the Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR). 

- The principal research inquiry pertains to the examination of disparities in mathematical scaled scores among first-grade students across different class configurations. Subsequent to identifying the existence of such differences
- A secondary line of inquiry focuses on determining the class configuration that correlates with the highest mathematical scaled scores in the first grade.

These two questions are of paramount importance because they relate to how educational quality can be enhanced through the deliberate control of class sizes. Resolving these questions can assist in elevating instructional efficacy through policy interventions. 

Specifically, understanding the impact of class size on student achievement, especially in critical subjects such as mathematics, allows policymakers to design more effective educational strategies. By identifying the class configuration that is most conducive to higher mathematical scaled scores among students, educators can tailor classroom environments to optimize learning outcomes.

# Background

The importance of class sizes on student achievement is a significant concern for policymakers in the American K-12 education system. To investigate this, the Tennessee State Department of Education initiated the Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR), a four-year longitudinal class-size study from 1985 to 1989. More than 7,000 students across 79 schools participated.

- **Random Assignment**: All participating schools agreed to random assignment of teachers and students to one of three class conditions: a small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), a regular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and a regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher's aide).

- **Continuity Through Grades**: In accordance with the experimental design, participants were to remain in their initially allocated class configurations—small, regular, or regular with aide—throughout the four-year duration of the study, spanning kindergarten to third grade. However, due to parental feedback, a reassignment occurred at the onset of the first grade for those in regular classes, facilitating a random distribution between regular classes with and without aides, while those in small classes continued without change. Additionally, students enrolling at the first-grade level in the study's second year underwent random assignment to one of the three predefined groups. 

- **Participation Requirements**:  To be part of the STAR project, schools needed to enroll a sufficient number of kindergarten students to allow distribution across the three class types.

- **Annual Assessment**:  Student achievement was measured annually using the Stanford Achievement Tests (SATs), conducted during the spring term on specific dates set by the state of Tennessee.

- **Handling Student Mobility**:  Students who moved from one STAR participating school to another were kept in the same type of class. It's noted that the size of a regular class could reduce to that of a small class due to student movement.

- **Focus on Class Size and Aides**:  The study concentrated solely on examining the effects of class size and the presence of teacher aides, without introducing other experimental variables.

- **School Participation Changes**:  After the kindergarten year, three schools withdrew from the STAR project, reducing the number of schools to 76 at the first-grade level.
